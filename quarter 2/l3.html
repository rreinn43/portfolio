<h1><b>Dead Girl</b></h1>
<p class="p1">
Outside the funeral home, I heard a boy say that she had fallen off the 
back of her boyfriend's motorcycle. Broken her neck. She never knew what 
hit her, he said. I was 13. The dead girl had been a junior in high school.
</p>
<p id="p2">
The line to see her snaked around the building. Boys with long hair, 
wearing ties they'd borrowed from their fathers, and girls with thick blue 
eyeshadow smoked cigarettes in the parking lot. Someone passed a bottle of 
Jack. There were no adults there, just very old kids.
</p>
<p class="p3">
She almost looked like she was sleeping, except that she was too still. 
There was a puffiness to her face that didn't seem quite right. They had 
dressed her for the prom; the crinoline sleeves of her gown like poofs of 
pink cotton candy. Some kids prayed, but I couldn't. I just stared at the 
roses in her corsage.
